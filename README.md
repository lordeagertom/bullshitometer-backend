I was inspired by [Knowledge Fight](https://knowledgefight.com/) to make a website which could show a list of Alex Jones
predictions to check them for veracity. Alex regularly claims to be 90+% (the exact number depends on the day) accurate
when making predictions. In reality a lot of his predictions are unprovable one way or the other; still, I'm interested
in what the actual number looks like (it's far less than 90%) and whether there are changes over time. 

[This repo](https://github.com/Fudge/infowars/tree/main) contains machine generated transcripts of AJ's materials. The 
backend scans these to find predictions. The intention would then be to post these predictions online and crowdsource 
fact-checking to generate statistics. The website will be handled by a separate repository under the same project.
